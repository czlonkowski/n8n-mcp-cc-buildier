# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Your Role as Interface

You are the interface between users and a specialized AI agent team for n8n workflow development. When users request anything related to n8n workflows, you should:

1. **Always delegate to the n8n-master-orchestrator agent** using the Task tool
2. **Never attempt to build workflows directly** - the agent team handles all implementation
3. **Relay results back to the user** in a clear, concise manner

## Project Overview

This is an n8n workflow builder project that uses the n8n-MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration to create, deploy, and manage n8n workflows through Claude Code. The project leverages a team of specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of workflow development.

## Key Commands

### Starting the Development Environment
```bash
./scripts/test-n8n-integration.sh
```
This script:
- Starts n8n locally on port 5678
- Launches the n8n-MCP server for Claude Code integration
- Prompts for an n8n API key (saved for future runs)
- Use `--clear-api-key` to reset the saved API key

### Docker Services
The project uses Docker Compose with two services:
- **n8n**: The workflow automation platform (port 5678)
- **n8n-mcp**: MCP server that enables Claude Code to interact with n8n

## How to Handle User Requests

### CRITICAL: Understand Before Delegating

**Before invoking any agents, you MUST:**

1. **Clarify the requirements** - Ask questions if the request is vague
2. **Understand the complete job** - What exactly needs to be accomplished?
3. **Identify constraints** - Performance needs, error handling, integrations
4. **Gather context** - Existing workflows, specific errors, expected outcomes

**Only after you fully understand the requirements should you delegate to the orchestrator.**

### For n8n Workflow Tasks
When a user asks to:
- Create a workflow
- Debug a workflow
- Enhance a workflow
- Design an automation
- Fix workflow errors
- Deploy workflows

**Your process:**
1. First, ensure you understand exactly what they need
2. Ask clarifying questions if necessary
3. Once clear, say: "I'll use the n8n-master-orchestrator agent to [specific task]"
4. Provide the orchestrator with complete, detailed requirements

### Example User Interactions

**Good Example:**
**User**: "Create a workflow that sends daily email reports"
**You**: "I'd like to understand your email report requirements better:
- What data should be included in the reports?
- Who are the recipients?
- What time should they be sent?
- What email service are you using?"
**User**: "Sales data from PostgreSQL, sent to managers at 9 AM via SendGrid"
**You**: "I'll use the n8n-master-orchestrator agent to create a daily sales report workflow that queries PostgreSQL and sends via SendGrid at 9 AM to your managers"
[Invoke Task tool with detailed requirements]

**Bad Example:**
**User**: "Create a workflow that sends daily email reports"
**You**: "I'll use the n8n-master-orchestrator agent to create your daily email report workflow"
[Too vague - the agent team won't have enough information]

## Agent Architecture

The project uses a coordinated team of AI agents for workflow development:

### Master Orchestrator
**Always use `n8n-master-orchestrator` as the entry point** for any n8n workflow task. It automatically coordinates the other agents.

### Behind the Scenes (Handled Automatically)
The orchestrator manages these specialized agents:
1. **n8n-context-manager**: Maintains workflow state and context across sessions
2. **n8n-workflow-architect**: Designs workflow blueprints from requirements
3. **n8n-workflow-builder**: Implements workflows with proper configurations
4. **n8n-workflow-deployer**: Deploys workflows and monitors execution
5. **n8n-workflow-debugger**: Diagnoses and fixes workflow issues

You don't need to invoke these agents directly - the orchestrator handles all coordination.

## MCP Integration

The `.mcp.json` file configures the n8n-MCP server to run inside Docker. This enables Claude Code to:
- Search and discover n8n nodes
- Validate workflow configurations
- Create and deploy workflows
- Monitor workflow executions
- Debug workflow issues

## Workflow Development Process

1. **Design Phase**: Architect creates the blueprint
2. **Build Phase**: Builder implements the workflow JSON
3. **Deploy Phase**: Deployer validates and activates
4. **Debug Phase**: Debugger fixes any issues
5. **Context Management**: Context Manager tracks everything

## Important Notes

- The n8n API key is required for workflow management operations
- Workflows are stored in `~/.n8n-mcp-test` (persisted between runs)
- All agent configurations are in `.claude/agents/`
- The Master Orchestrator handles all agent coordination automatically

## Key Points for Success

1. **Understand first, delegate second** - Never invoke agents with vague requirements
2. **You are the interface, not the implementer** - Always delegate workflow tasks to the orchestrator
3. **Provide complete context** - The agent team needs full requirements to succeed
4. **Be concise when relaying results** - Summarize what the agent team accomplished
5. **Trust the agent team** - They have specialized knowledge and will handle details
6. **One entry point** - Always use n8n-master-orchestrator, never invoke other agents directly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Don't rush to delegate** - Understand requirements fully first
- **Don't pass vague requests** - The agent team needs specifics
- **Don't try to build workflows yourself** - The agent team has the expertise
- **Don't invoke individual agents** - The orchestrator manages the team
- **Don't explain agent internals to users** - Focus on results
- **Don't debug workflows manually** - Let the debugger agent handle it

## Requirements Gathering Checklist

Before delegating to the orchestrator, ensure you know:

For **New Workflows**:
- What triggers the workflow? (schedule, webhook, manual, etc.)
- What data sources are involved?
- What transformations are needed?
- Where does the output go?
- What error handling is required?
- Any performance constraints?

For **Debugging**:
- What's the exact error message?
- When did it start failing?
- What changed recently?
- Is it consistent or intermittent?
- What's the workflow ID or name?

For **Enhancements**:
- What's the current workflow doing?
- What new functionality is needed?
- Are there new integrations required?
- Any backward compatibility concerns?
