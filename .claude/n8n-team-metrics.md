## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs
1. **Time to Value** - From request to working workflow
2. **First-Time Success Rate** - Workflows working without debug
3. **Agent Collaboration Efficiency** - Smooth handoffs
4. **Pattern Learning Rate** - Reusable solutions created

### Quality KPIs
1. **Error Prevention Rate** - Issues caught before production
2. **Performance Optimization** - Workflow efficiency gains
3. **Maintainability Score** - How easy to modify workflows
4. **Documentation Quality** - Clarity of agent outputs

### Efficiency KPIs
1. **Handoff Overhead** - Time spent on transitions
2. **Parallel Processing** - Agents working concurrently
3. **Resource Utilization** - Optimal agent selection
4. **Automation Level** - Manual intervention required

  location: [between which agents]
  frequency: [occurrences per week]
  average_delay: [minutes]
  root_cause: [analysis]
  proposed_solution: [improvement]
```

- Zero critical errors in production

### Medium-term (Monthly)
- First-deployment success rate > 90%
- Average time to production < 20 minutes
- Pattern reuse rate > 60%
- 50% reduction in debug cycles

### Long-term (Quarterly)
- First-deployment success rate > 95%
- Average time to production < 15 minutes
- Pattern reuse rate > 75%
- Fully automated simple workflows

## Reporting Schedule

1. **Real-time Dashboard** - Always available
2. **Daily Summary** - End of each day
3. **Weekly Report** - Monday mornings
4. **Monthly Analysis** - First of month
5. **Quarterly Review** - Strategic planning

## Action Items from Metrics

When metrics indicate issues:

### Low Success Rate
1. Review recent failures with Debugger
2. Update patterns with Context Manager
3. Enhance validation in Builder
4. Improve designs with Architect

### Slow Performance
1. Identify bottleneck agents
2. Optimize handoff protocols
3. Increase parallel processing
4. Simplify complex workflows

### High Rework Rate
1. Improve initial requirements gathering
2. Enhance Architect's design validation
3. Strengthen Builder's testing
4. Update team protocols

## Metric Storage

All metrics stored by Context Manager:
- Real-time metrics in memory
- Historical data in persistent storage
- Patterns and learnings in knowledge base
- Performance trends in analytics system
